# zmon
Quick &amp; dirty HWMonitor-clone for Linux, written in Python and using GTK-bindings.
Far from finished, a work-in-progress.
Requires Python and its standard libraries, as well as Python GTK3.0-bindings (which may or may not be included in standard libraries), and `sensors` ([lm-sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lm_sensors)) as a %PATH% executable.
Works out-of-the-box on GTK-derived GNU/Linux distributions such as LMDE 6 'Faye'.
*Should* work with other systems (Windows, KDE-derived distributions) as well as long as the Python environment is set up correctly and lm-sensors is available.
